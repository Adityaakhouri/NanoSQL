## üéØ Key Features

1. **Database Operations:**
   - **Create Database:** Users can easily create new MongoDB databases directly from the interface.
   - **Drop Database:** Allows users to delete an existing database that is no longer needed, freeing up resources.

2. **Table Operations:**
   - **Create Table:** Users can create tables within MongoDB databases, with customizable attributes and primary keys for structured data.
   - **Drop Table:** Facilitates the deletion of tables from databases when no longer required.
   - **Insert Data:** A seamless process for inserting records into tables, enabling data population without any manual effort.
   - **Delete Data:** Users can remove specific records or entire rows from tables, with full control over data deletion.

3. **Indexing:**
   - **Create Index:** Users can create indexes on tables to significantly enhance the speed and performance of queries, especially on large datasets.

4. **Visual Editor:**
   - **Insert Data:** The visual editor simplifies the insertion of data into MongoDB collections, making it accessible even to users with minimal technical knowledge.
   - **Delete Data:** Users can select and delete specific data rows directly from MongoDB collections via the visual editor for easy data management.

5. **Selection:**
   - **Select Data:** Users can retrieve specific data from tables based on given conditions, following SQL-style SELECT statements.
   - **Filtering:** Data can be filtered using WHERE clauses, allowing for more precise queries and better control over data retrieval.
   - **Grouping:** Grouping of data is possible based on specific attributes using GROUP BY clauses, which helps in organizing the data.
   - **Aggregate Functions:** Users can perform aggregate functions such as `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, and others on the selected data to derive meaningful insights.
   - **Joins:** Users can join multiple tables based on common attributes, allowing them to retrieve combined data from different sources.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Installation:** Clone the repository to your local machine by running the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adityaakhouri/MiniDBMS
   
2. Run the Application: To start the application, run the main Java program. This will initialize the server and open the GUI, where users can interact with the database.

3. Connect to Database: Once the application is running, users can connect to their MongoDB database using the provided interface in the GUI. MongoDB credentials and the database name need to be provided.

4. Visual Editor: Users can easily insert, delete, or update data records in MongoDB collections through the visual editor. This user-friendly tool is designed to simplify data management tasks.

5. Manual Input: For more experienced users, CRUD operations can be executed directly through manual command input, allowing for more advanced database manipulation.

6. Interact with GUI: Users can explore the various features of the GUI, including visualizations, data queries, and complete database management capabilities.

# üõ†Ô∏è System Requirements
Java Version: Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later.

Network Connectivity: Users need internet access to connect to remote MongoDB servers. Ensure that firewall settings permit communication over port 27017.

# ‚öõÔ∏è Technologies Used


Java: The core programming language for the application's backend logic and server-side functionality, ensuring reliable performance.

MongoDB: A NoSQL database that stores and manages structured data in a flexible and scalable format, making it ideal for dynamic datasets.

JSON: A lightweight data interchange format used to transfer data between the Java application and MongoDB.

Socket Programming: Facilitates client-server communication, enabling multiple users to interact with the database concurrently.

Swing: A Java GUI toolkit used to build the rich graphical interface, providing an easy-to-navigate environment for users to interact with the database.
